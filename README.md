# VolantaFlightsToCSV
A project to take Volanta Flight Sim Recorder data and turn it's recorded flights into CSV for easy use of other programs

The method of downloading flight data is strange, as it appears Volanta only allows one full extraction of the data.
This may be an oversight of Volanta, but I found another method of extracting the data.
The downside is that it is a lot more hands-on.
In the Volanta Web App, open the browser Dev Tools, and open the network tab.
Click through to a flight that you want to extract in the web app.
The network tab will find a json file that contains the flight data.
Copy the json file to the clipboard.
Paste the json file into a text editor, and save it as a .json file.

This project makes use of the GSON library to parse the json file.
I am using GSON version 2.8.6 because it has the function to parse the json file.
The main reason for this being noted is that it appears the functions I am using are deprecated, so I do not know if it is supported by newer versions.
